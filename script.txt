1. A how-to-guide on robotic arm manipulation in ROS

2. If this is your first time working with a robot arm, it may seem daunting,
even terrifying. Maybe you have nightmares about it. Today, we'll walk you through 
the initial set up, creating a testing scenario, and finally, how to use the hardware without pulling out your hair.

3. Here's the initial set up

4. First, attach the positive leads to the red wire and the negative leads 
to the black wire. Make sure that the power supply is turned off! Otherwise you're
 in for quite the shock! (pause) Then, turn on the power supply and supply the arm with 12 V. 

5. Bring up the terminal in ROS. We must build the packages inside catkin workspace.
 Once that is finished, reopen the terminal. Set up ROS with the bash file. And be 
absolutely sure you have activate the arm's USB port. You've made it. You can finally 
launch either the arm simulation or the hardware arm itself.

6. ROS includes sliders which can be used to move the elbow and medial joints of the arm. Because who cares about the other joints, you only have 2 DOF.

7. Here's what a functioning arm looks like, in case you were wondering.

8. You can also test the arm in a simulator.

9. Using the terminal, publish a message to /right_arm_controller/command. This message must include all 5 joints, empty velocities, accelerations, and effort arrays, and you must input a value for time_from_start to give the arm time to move.

10. If a terminal command is not your thing, you can also effect the arm with a python script. Make sure all the joints are specified and the array values match the joints. You can use an if statement to control what position your arm is moving to.

Oh look! He might be starting the macarena!

11. Despite this perfect environment, you may find yourself having problems with ROS...

12. Exhibit A. The sliders are not as accurate as you think. To find out how, you must turn the sliders off and on again.

13. Here are one example of how the same position can yield different results.

I hope you've learned something because we did and it was a slow, tedious process. Happy effecting!
